This is the NEW Flutter Riverpod Template Project.

It follows the "App & Layers" structure (referencing GetX style).

To define this as the new project, I have placed this file here.
Please rename the parent folder manually if desired using your OS file explorer.

Project Structure:
- lib/app (Configuration, Core, Routing)
- lib/layers (Domain, Data, Presentation)

Run ./setup.sh to initialize iOS/Android folders!
